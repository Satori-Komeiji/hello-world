# hello-world
Just doing the tutorial...

I'm just going to write a bit about myself.
Obviously I'm a Touhou fan.  I'm been into computers ever since I was a little kid and have always been quite the renaissance man.
I'm quite good at art, math, chemistry, physics, problem solving, programming, creativity, ect...

My IQ is fair, I've had it mesured at 183.  Although I don't know if I really believe that the IQ is something that can be mesured by a test.  There are many different types of intellegent people, some may not score high on an IQ test.

I know my mom is politically intelegent while my father can beat almost anyone at chess (both the game and in life lol).

Anyways I can go on and on... I'll just leave it at that.
